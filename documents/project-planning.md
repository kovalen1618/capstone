# Research

### List of applications researched

- What do you like about each site
  - _Pomofocus_: The app is intuitive, nice looking, contains a report section showing graphs of user progress, and has a lot of customization
  - _Super-Productivity_: Has the ability to add Projects for switching between different focus profiles on certain days (study Tuesday, work Thursday, YouTube Saturday)
  - _Health by Apple_: Allows the tracking of different health aspects and returns data in that form

- What do you NOT like about each site
  - _Pomofocus_: Simply lacks some of my vision for displaying information to users and is a pomodoro focused productivity application
  - _Super-Productivity_: Not super intuitive, and when explaining features in the app it is filled with long paragraphs of instructions
  - _Health by Apple_: Adding/editing content is not very intuitive and it does not automatically update graphs from a bundle of data you put in unless using a device like an Apple Watch

- How will your application be different
  - My application will display a few graphs at once with a fair amount of information and allow for a seamless adding/editing/deletion and progression of tasks
