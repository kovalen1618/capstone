# Research

### List of applications researched

- What do you like about each site
  - _Cozi_: Has a recipe page that family members can choose from a wide variety of dishes
  - _FamilyWall_: The homepage displays a "wall" of cards for a plethora of options such as budgets,
  photo galleries, and even location tracking for everyone.
  - _Pixie_: Allows users to create "boards" so family members can view important information about
  specific family issues such as home maitenance, car needs, etc. while giving suggestions for what
  might need to be done

- What do you NOT like about each site
  - _Cozi_: The interface is bland and doesn't have a lot of options for what tasks need to be done
  - _FamilyWall_: It does not display any time-sensitive information on the homepage
  - _Pixie_: Adding/editing content is not very intuitive

- How will your application be different
  - My application will display time-sensitive tasks on the homepage and will have a much more
  intuitive UI with better styling.
